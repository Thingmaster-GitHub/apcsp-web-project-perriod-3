      <h2 class="heading">DNS</h2>
      <p>The internet is a very, large, complicated system.Connecting all computers on the internet Directly would be expensive and impractical, so that is not how it works. Instead of doing this impossible task, it uses <span class="bold">DNS</span>. DNS stands for <span class="bold">Domain Name System</span>. this system allows URLS to be exchanged for the IP adress that leads to the server that you are trying to connect to. It has many redundant servers so that it if one server breaks it does not all go down with it, making the system <span class="bold">fault tolerant</span>. these many DNS servers are very <span class="bold">scalable</span> with different top level domans represented by different servers allowing for many different domains to be represented. these top level domains have a root domain located before them, allowing for even more variation. The number of these redundant servers make the system very <span class="bold">reliable</span>.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The wider internet aside from <span class="bold">DNS</span> also has simalar systems in place.</p> <!should propably add images and break up text.>
