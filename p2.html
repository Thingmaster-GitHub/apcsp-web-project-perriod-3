      <h1 class="title">HTTP and IP </h1>
  <p>IP stands for Internet Protocol and is designed to deliver data 
  from one device to another. 
  The IP defines packets adresses and routes so they can travel over various networks. 
  HTTPS helps secure and encyrpt the packets as they travel to their destination. 
  So IP routes the path that the encrypted HTTPS packet must take.</p>
