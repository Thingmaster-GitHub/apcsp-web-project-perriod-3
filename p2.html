  </ol> IP stands for Internet Protocol and is designed to deliver data 
  from one device to another. 
  The IP defines packet addresses and routes so they can travel over various networks. 
  The IP is responsible for determining the best possible path for packets 
  to make sure the packet is as efficient as possible
  HTTPS helps secure and encrypt the packets as they travel to their destination. 
  So IP routes the path that the encrypted HTTPS packet must take. When a person clicks on a website for example
  HTTPS will make a secure connection between he user's device and the website.
